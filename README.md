# JavaScript Calculator

So here is the mandatory calculator project! Nothing fancy (the color scheme is
especially a nightmare for a designer), but all functions work as expected. It is
very simple, but I must say I enjoyed making it!

TO-DO's:
    - The code needs to be cleaned-up.
    - Keyboard support!
    - Backspace support!
    - Maybe an expression parser/evaluator? (Not JavaScript eval()!)
